If you leave your virtual machine, your database may not be saved. You can make a dump of it by entering pg_dump -cC --inserts -U freecodecamp worldcup > worldcup.sql in a bash terminal (not the psql one). It will save the commands to rebuild your database in worldcup.sql. The file will be located where the command was entered. If it's anything inside the project folder, the file will be saved in the VM. You can rebuild the database by entering psql -U postgres < worldcup.sql in a terminal where the .sql file is.
